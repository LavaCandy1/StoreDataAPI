This project is the backend service for a Shopify Data Analytics application. It connects to the Shopify Admin API to fetch store data, processes it, and exposes a secure RESTful API for a front-end client.

## About The Project

This application was developed to provide Shopify store owners with a simple, clear interface to analyze their sales data. It allows users to connect multiple stores and view key metrics and trends.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following :

- Java (JDK) 17 or later
- Maven or Gradle
- A running instance of PostgreSQL
- A [Shopify Partner Account](https://www.shopify.com/partners) to create a development store and app.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/LavaCandy1/StoreDataAPI]
    ```

2.  **Configure the database:**

    - Log in to PostgreSQL and create a new database for this project.
    - Example: `CREATE DATABASE shopify_analytics_db;`

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    - Navigate to `src/main/resources/`.
    - Open the `application-local.properties` file and update the following values with your local configuration.

    ```properties
    # ---------------------------------
    # DATABASE CONFIGURATION
    # ---------------------------------
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/shopify_analytics_db #or you db name in place of shopify_analytics_db
    spring.datasource.username=[Your_Postgres_Username]
    spring.datasource.password=[Your_Postgres_Password]

    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

    ```

4.  **Build and run the application:**

    ```sh
    # Build the project
    mvn clean install

    # Run the application
    mvn spring-boot:run
    # or run the StoreDataApiApplication.java file from src/main/java/com/AyushGarg/StoreDataapi/
    ```

The API server should now be running on `http://localhost:8000`.
